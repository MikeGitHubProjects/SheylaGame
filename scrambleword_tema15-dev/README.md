### _assigment date: 31.10.2022 9:00_

## Summary

This is a word scramble game. The game is made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The game is made for "Academia For Future".

The main files of this project are located inside the "public" folder:

- `index.html` - the main HTML file
- `style.css` - the main CSS file
- `main.js` - the main JavaScript file

## Steps to reproduce

Open the `index.html` file in your browser and follow the game instructions.

## Requirements

### HACKATON: SCRAMBLE WORDS REQUIREMENTS:

- at least 3 different game topics
- minimum 3 levels of difficulty (words of 6, 7, 8 letters, etc.).
  - no less than 6 letters in a word
- find at least 10 words on each level so you can move on to the next level.
- maximum 5 attempts to guess the word
  - if it was guessed in 5 attempts, move on to the next word
  - if it was not guessed, it is reset to the level you are at and it is taken from the first word
- to get a new attempt per word, play rock, paper, scissors against a bot. If you win you have one more try, if you don't win you have to wait 30 seconds before you can play again.
- responsive
- UX friendly
- at least one optional :-)

### OPTIONALS:

- as a level of difficulty, the selection of the language in which to display the words can be entered
- a "practice" module => where you have some easy words to get used to the game system (here they can be words of 4 or 5 letters)
- a module for children => to arrange the letters for a word found in an image
- a module "arranging scrambled words" => the module where you can arrange words to get phrases.
- a module with hints (easy type) => where besides the "scrambled" letters you also have a hint to what the word represents (a city, an animal, a profession.)
